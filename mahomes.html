          <h4>Biography</h4>
          <p>Patrick Mahomes is an NFL Quarterback who currently plays for the Kansas City Chiefs. An all around athlete, Mahomes was a phenom at football and baseball, considering his dad, Patrick Mahomes Sr,was an MLB pitcher. He dropped baseball in his sophomore year of college and was selected as the 10th overall pick by the Chiefs in the 2017 NFL Draft. He spent his first rookie season as a backup to then-starter Alex Smith, but got his shot the following year when Smith was traded to the Washington Redskins. To this day, he is the most successful active NFL quarterback, as he made it to his first AFC Championship in his first year as a starter, only to fall short to Tom Brady and the patriots. The following year, during the 2019-20 season, he won his first superbowl by defeating the San Fransico 49ers, and although he would make it the following year, he fell short once again to Tom Brady. Even though he would not make the superbowl in the 2021-22 season, he still made it to the AFC Championship. However, his next two seasons changed everything, as he defied all odds by winning back to back superbowls, first defeating the Eagles in 2023 and repeating history by defeating the 49ers, just 4 years later in 2024. His agility and ridiculous throws has inspired young quarterbacks across the world to this day.</p>
