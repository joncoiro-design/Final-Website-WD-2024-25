            <h4>Biography</h4>
            <p>Matthew Stafford is an NFL quarterback who currently plays for the Los Angeles Rams. He played for the Georgia Bulldogs from 2006-2008, making appearances in bowl games for 3 years. His performance earned him the spot of the 1st overall pick, in which he was selected by the Detroit Lions in the 2009 NFL Draft. His breakout year was 2011, in which he became the 4th NFL quarterback to throw for  over 5,000 yards in an NFL season. He also gave the Lions their first playoff birth since 1999, and even though he did this again in 2014 & 2016, there was no superbowl to show for. A month after the conclusion of the wacky COVID 2020-21 season, he was traded to the Los Angeles 
Rams, a trade that made fans from Detroit hate him. Despite this, he turned the clock back in his inagural season with LA, in which it also happened to be the Rams first season in SOFI Stadium with fans. It also happened to be the host for that year's superbowl, and when the rams made it, they were able to play in front of practically all of their fans. With a complimenting receiver core in Cooper Kupp & OBJ, they ended the cinderella run of the Cincinnati Bengals, and Stafford won his first superbowl. Unfortunately, the rams missed the playoffs the following year, and then had an early wild card exit to Stafford's old team the year after.</p>
